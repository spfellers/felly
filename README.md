## Ideas:

* Have Component list of small project things?
* List of components will contain:
    * Title
    * description
    * github link to module
* Each of the components will be a separate feature module

## TODOS:

* Get HTTPS setup with cloudflare

## Questions:

* Is it worth it to e2e test
    * probably not, the plan as of now is to have all the feature modules be independent
    * also its super timely for a silly app that I have limited time to write

* scss vs. css
    * css is lighter, more widespread
    * use scss at job so will build a better understanding of differences
    * can always go css => scss, going back would take time
